 <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
 <div class="column1of2">
     <h3>The First Bicycle</h3>
     <p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him
     get around the royal gardensA machine (or mechanical device) is a mechanical structure
     that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action.
     Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water,
     and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape
     the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement. They can
     also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems.

 <p class="dis"> Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices
     that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage.
     Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and
     control components and include interfaces for convenient use. Examples include a wide range of vehicles,
     such as automobiles, boats and airplanes, appliances in the home and office, including computers, building
     a and obots.
