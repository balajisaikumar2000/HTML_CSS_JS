<h3>The First Bicycle</h3>
<p id="page">In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him
    get around the royal gardensA machine (or mechanical device) is a mechanical structure
    that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action.
    Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water,
    and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape
    the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement. They can
    also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems.
